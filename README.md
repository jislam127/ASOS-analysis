It indicates the colors for the upcoming fall season, as those colors are most prominent during then. This reflects the classic fall colors that are popular within the fashion industry, and shows the transition into fall season. The most popular colors based on our findings, indicate this as well.
Using pd.cut, I binned the products into categories based on their price. This showed me the number of items that were more on the expensive side versus products that were more affordable. 
I also found average prices based on the brand, using a group by function.

Maids to Measure, Six Stories, and Bardot are some of the most expensive brands based on my findings. Maids to Measure is a bridal wear company; we can accept items from this brand to have a higher price point due to their industry. Six Stores is a bridal and occasionwear company. Due to the market they serve, we can expect higher price points. Bardot focuses on slow, ethical, and sustainable practices which lead to higher price points on their prices.

We were able to uncover trends of the season, brands which lead with pricing, and how many clothing items were catered towards affordability versus luxury.
